#Front End Challenge

## Overview:
This repo contains the code for a responsive navbar. It demonstrates the use of web standards, including HTML5, uses a separate CSS file, makes the navbar responsive with at least one breakpoint, follows the style guidelines provided for this challenge, and includes buttons to logout 

## File Structure:

* Index.html (in main folder)
* main.css (in css folder)
* app.js (in js folder)

I chose to keep the folder structure fairly simple, since this coding challenge is centered around one particular feature. Though, if it were a fully functional app, I would consider using a more robust MVC framework, like Ruby on Rails or Node.js. 

## Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Git/GitHub

For this challenge, I chose to use the Bootstrap framework to help streamline the process of creating the responsive navbar. Though, I'd be excited to take on the challenge of creating a responsive design using plain CSS and media queries.
