#General Assembly Front End Challenge

## Overview:
This repo contains the code for a responsive navbar. It demonstrates the use of web standards, including HTML5, uses a separate CSS file, makes the navbar responsive with at least one breakpoint, follows the style guidelines provided for this challenge, and includes buttons to logout 

## File Structure:

* index.html (in main folder)
* screen.scss (in my_sass/sass folder)
* app.js (in js folder)

I chose to keep the folder structure fairly simple, since this coding challenge is centered around one particular feature. Though, if it were a fully functional app, I would consider using a more robust MVC framework, like Ruby on Rails or Node.js. 


## Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Git/GitHub

For this challenge, I chose to use the Bootstrap framework to help streamline the process of creating the responsive navbar. Since, this challenge has us a bit strapped for time, I chose this route, though, if given more time, I'd be excited to take on the challenge of creating a responsive design using plain CSS and media queries. 

Also, I used the jQuery library in order to create the javascript control for the login/logout button. Right now, I have a variable manually controlling the function in my Javascript. Though, in a real-life situation, I know I would have to create a helper method to link the user variable with the database.


## Wishlist/Future Development
One thing I must mention is that I aimed to use Sass on my feature. I started to setup the file structure to incorporate Sass, which explains why I have my main css files in a .scss file. Though, I ran out of time to incorporate the Sass syntax. Right now, the main styles are in css. Had I enough time, I would complete the styles in Sass.

Additionally, I would try to incorporate CSS transition animations.
